**Implement combined trading strategy with budget control**

This script introduces a trading strategy that utilizes RSI, MACD, and Bollinger Bands indicators, along with fixed cost position sizing. Each trade invests $5 (USDT/USDC), and the strategy enforces a maximum total investment limit of $1000 to control overall exposure. This implementation aims to provide systematic signal generation and robust risk management for algorithmic trading applications.
